Yo! I'm Stefankowal3
💻 About Me
🎓 I'm a computer science student (4th semester) living in Poland, currently working full-time at a private company.

🔧 I work as a stage lighting service technician – specializing in the maintenance, repair, and configuration of professional stage equipment.

🎭 I’ve worked with brands like MA Lighting, Christie, Martin, LumenRadio, Luminex, and Chauvet Professional, and I’ve participated in setting up permanent lighting installations in theaters and event venues. I also do a bit of programming and provide helpdesk support for employees.

⚡ Outside of work and studies, I’m passionate about blockchain tech and love experimenting with hardware (Arduino, Raspberry Pi).
